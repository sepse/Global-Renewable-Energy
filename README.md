# Global Renewable Energy :earth_africa: :recycle: :sunny:
A data science research project, analyzing global renewable energy production

## Introduction

## Objective
The objective of this data science project is to analyze global renewable energy production from different sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric power. By using big data analytics techniques, we aim to gain insights into the current trends and patterns associated with each source. This analysis is crucial because the development of clean energy resources is essential for addressing climate change and promoting sustainability worldwide. Understanding how these technologies perform at large scales helps policymakers make informed decisions related to energy infrastructure investments, which ultimately impacts both economic growth and environmental preservation. With this research, we hope to contribute towards building a more resilient future through better use of natural resources.

## What is Renewable Energy?

Renewable energy comes from sources or processes that are constantly replenished. These sources of energy include solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and hydroelectric power.

Renewable sources are often associated with green energy and clean energy, but there are some subtle differences between these three energy types. Where renewable sources are those that are recyclable, clean energy are those that do not release pollutants like carbon dioxide, and green energy is that which comes from natural sources. While there is often cross-over between these energy types, not all types of renewable energy are actually fully clean or green. For example, some hydroelectric sources can actually damage natural habitats and cause deforestation.

Tidal Power

Renewable energy offers a range of benefits including offering a freely available source of energy generation. As the sector grows there has also been a surge in job creation to develop and install the renewable energy solutions of tomorrow. Renewable sources also offer greater energy access in developing nations and can reduce energy bills too.

Of course, one of the largest benefits of renewable energy is that much of it also counts as green and clean energy. This has created a growth in renewable energy, with wind and solar being particularly prevalent.

However, these green benefits are not the sole preserve of renewable energy sources. Nuclear power is also a zero-carbon energy source, since it generates or emits very low levels of CO2. Some favour nuclear energy over resources such as solar and wind, since nuclear power is a stable source that is not reliant on weather conditions. Which brings us onto some of the disadvantages of renewable energy.
