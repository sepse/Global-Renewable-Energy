# Global Renewable Energy :earth_africa::closed_book::sunny:
A data science research project, analyzing global renewable energy production

# Objective
The objective of this data science project is to analyze global renewable energy production from different sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric power. By using big data analytics techniques, we aim to gain insights into the current trends and patterns associated with each source. This analysis is crucial because the development of clean energy resources is essential for addressing climate change and promoting sustainability worldwide. Understanding how these technologies perform at large scales helps policymakers make informed decisions related to energy infrastructure investments, which ultimately impacts both economic growth and environmental preservation. With this research, we hope to contribute towards building a more resilient future through better use of natural resources.
